1. An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. 
   A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
   Examples for inline elements: span, a, img, b, br.
   Examples for blockline elements: hr, div, p, address.

2. <img/> tag is used to add the images to our webpage.
   It has many attributes mainly it has src, width, height,alt.
   src is used to give the image file like image.png and alt is used to give text to image.

3. In html we have 3 types of lists.
  They are ordered list,unordered list, discription list.
  Inorder to create the ordered list we have to use <ol> and to create unordered list we have to use <ul>
  and to create discrption list we have to use <dl>.

4. To interlink interlink the wepages we have to use the anchor tag <a>
   And href is the attribute of <a> tag.
   the link is given in the href so that it will navigate people to other page.
   example: <a href="www.google.com>santhosh</a>
